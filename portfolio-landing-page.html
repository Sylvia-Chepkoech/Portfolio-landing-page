        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p><strong>Hello, my name is Sylvia</strong> and I enjoy moonlight strolls on the beach, red roses by the armful and participation dances.</p>
        <p>Just kidding! I'm not a fan of any of those things. More seriously, my friends would describe me as easy going and a good listener. My favorite thing  in life is time spent around the table. And all the better with some seriously tasty food to bring us all together.</p>
        <p>I'm a recent graduate with a background in a medical field. I chose to embark on this journey of programming since #Techisthefuture. I also wanted too rekindle and old passion and I believe tech and medicine can compliment each other one way or the other. I am definetly excited to be a part of the tech world.</p>
    
        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I do not enjoy a lot of this, but the few things that do make every minute spent on it worth while. I could tell you a few;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Listening to podcasts</li>
            <li>Yoga</li>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Baking</li>
          </ul>
