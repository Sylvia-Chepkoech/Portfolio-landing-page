    <h1><strong>Just a bit about Sylvia</strong></h1>
    <h2><emp>About Me</emp></h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sylvia and I enjoy moonlight strolls on the beach, red roses by the armful and participation dances.</p>
    <p>Just kidding! I'm not a fan of any of those things. More seriously, my friends would describe me as easy going and a good listener. My favorite thing  in life is time spent around the table. And all the better with some seriously tasty food to bring us all together.</p>
    <p>I'm a recent graduate with a background in a medical field. I chose to embark on this journey of programming since #Techisthefuture. I also wanted too rekindle and old passion and I believe tech and medicine can compliment each other one way or the other. I am definetly excited to be a part of the tech world.</p>
